# flatiron-blog01-idle-animations
the code for demonstrating how to create basic idle animation behavior in a web browser using javascript. The goal is to protray more "natural" behavior by introducing randomness to the behavior intervals.

This example uses separate image sprites rather than a sprite sheet, as the focus is on how the assets are utilized, rather than how they are obtained.

Note that this was designed to exclusively examine the logic utilized in implementing structured randomness within idle character animations, so the code is not designed to scale up, and animations used with this exact code may encounter problems. It is recommended to use the concepts illustrated in this code's associated blog to build similar structured randomness into the code governing your own character's idle behaviors and animations rather than using the functions as-is.
