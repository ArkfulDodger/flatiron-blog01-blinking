# flatiron-blog01-blinking
the code for demonstrating how to create basic idle animation behavior in a web browser using javascript. The goal is to protray more "natural" behavior by introducing randomness to the behavior intervals.

This example uses separate image sprites rather than a sprite sheet, as the focus is on how the assets are utilized, rather than how they are obtained.
